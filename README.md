# Coastwide Sablefish Project

Queries, data prep, and analysis for ADFG data requested by K. Fenske. 2017-12-26. Contact: Jane Sullivan (jane.sullivan1@alaska.gov)

All queries and data prep can be found in r/query_n_clean.r. 

## Catch by gear and ADFG management area, 1960-present, or other dates (going back in time) as available. 

Pers. comm. with K. Fenske 2018-01-03: she already has Aluetian Is. data from AKFIN and only needs state data for NSEI, SSEI, and PWS. 

I suggested using the Gross Earnings File (GEF) as the definitive source for statewide catch reconstructions based on the recommendation of J. Shriver. Column descriptions for GEF in data/catch/gross_earnings_file/GEF_Variable_Descriptions_Working_JShriver_2014_12_08.xlsx. Descriptions for ADFG management areas can be found in adfg_mgt_area_metadata_slarsen.shp. S. Larsen also helped me update some of the stat area NAs in Region 1 and 2, source file data/catch/gross_earnings_file/SJL_region2_statareas_districts

I supplied three data files for catch:

1.  data/catch/gross_earnings_file/regions1n2_statewater_sablecatch_gef_1975_2016.csv -- Just catch in statewaters in Regions 1 and 2, which include the follow management areas: Northern Southeast Inside (NSEI), Southern Southeast Inside (SSEI), Prince William Sound (PWS), and Cook Inlet (CI).

2.  data/catch/gross_earnings_file/allak_sablecatch_gef_1975_2016_CONFIDENTIAL.csv -- These are all records for sablefish from the GEF, in case Kari wants to use the GEF instead of a combination of AKFIN and GEF. 

3.  data/catch/nsei_historicalsablecatch_nosource_carlile_1907_2000.csv -- An interesting but undocumented time series of catch in Chatham Strait going back to 1907.

## Abundance index estimates (or absolute abundance) from survey, mark-recapture, or fishery data, by year, standardized if possible or noted as unstandardized if they arenâ€™t. Biomass and abundance only available for Chatham Strait.

These estimates are only currently available for Chatham Strait (NSEI). I included abundance (age-2+), biomass (age-4+), and ABC/corresponding harvest policy when available. I used Franz's age-structured assessment to populate 1980-2002, but this model was not used for management. We are working on CPUE, and can provide those estimates at a later date.

## Natural mortality used or estimated. 

All recent assessments used for management have assumed M = 0.1. 

## Biological data: Maturation at age proportions, Age composition data for survey and/or fisheries (by survey/gear, if available), Length composition data for survey and/or fisheries (by survey/gear, if available), length and weight at age from survey(s) and fisheries

To my knowledge ADFG only has sablefish biological data for NSEI and SSEI. Code for biological summaries in r/biodata_analysis.r

Column name descriptions:
length: fork length, cm 
weight: kg 
Matuirty: "0" = immature, "1" = mature
Gear: indicates gear used (pot or longline)
Source: fishery or survey
Mgmt_area: NSEI is Chatham Strait, SSEI is Clarence Strait

Biological data are available for the following Gear/Source/Mgmt_area combinations as follows:

|      Gear|  Source| Mgmt_area| min_year| max_year|
|----------|--------|----------|---------|---------|
|  Longline| Fishery|      NSEI|     2000|     2017|
|  Longline| Fishery|      SSEI|     2001|     2017|
|  Longline|  Survey|      NSEI|     1985|     2017|
|  Longline|  Survey|      SSEI|     1986|     2017|
|       Pot| Fishery|      SSEI|     1998|     2017|
|       Pot|  Survey|      NSEI|     1981|     2017|
|       Pot|  Survey|      SSEI|     1979|     1983|

The requested summaries are available in data/biological: allsable_proportionmature.csv, allsable_agecomps.csv, allsable_lengthcomps.csv, allsable_lengthage.csv, and allsable_lengthweight.csv. Analysis was conducted at various levels of detail, specified by the "description" column. For example, I provided output for NSEI/SSEI separately and combined.

The detailed version of the fishery data are available in data/biological/fishery/detailed_fisherybio_nsei_ssei_1988_2017.csv.  The pot and longline survey data are available in data/biological/survey: detailed_potsrvbio_nsei_ssei_1979_2017.csv and detailed_llsrvbio_nsei_ssei_1985_2017.csv.

## Von Bertalanffy growth rate parameters

I provided parameter estimates for Chatham Strait in data/biological/compare_vonb_adfg_noaa.csv. This was from an earlier analysis, and the code is available at https://github.com/commfish/seak_sablefish/blob/master/r_code/biological.R
